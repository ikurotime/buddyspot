## Advice on pull requests
Pull requests are the easiest way to contribute the changes to git repos at GitHub. They are the preferred contribution method, as they offer a nice way for commenting and amending the proposed changes.
* If you later need to add new commits to the pull request, you can simply commit the changes to the local branch and then use ```git push``` to automatically update the pull request.

## Commits in your pull-requests should
* Have a useful description.
* Have some images regarding the changes done by you.

## If you have commit access
* Do NOT use ```git push --force```.
* Use Pull Requests if you are unsure and to suggest changes to other maintainers.
* Do NOT commit to other maintainer's packages without their consent.
